<h1>HW4 – OpenGL Basics</h1>

<p>This page shows my work for HW4. I ran all the demos and took screenshots, and then answered the questions.</p>

<hr>

<h2>A. Demo Screenshots</h2>

<h3>1. TriangleColored</h3>
<p>This demo draws a simple colored triangle.</p>

<h3>2. Cube3D</h3>
<p>This one shows a rotating 3D cube with a perspective view.</p>

<h3>3. CubeLit</h3>
<p>This cube has basic lighting added, so you can see bright and dark sides.</p>

<h3>4. ModelLoad</h3>
<p>This is the model loaded from the models folder (default cube).</p>

<h2>B. Questions</h2>

<h3>Q1. What happens if I remove the depth test?</h3>
<p>
If I remove the depth test, OpenGL stops checking which surface is closer.
Faces are drawn only in drawing order.  
Because of that, the cube looks wrong: some back faces show up in front.
</p>

<h3>Q2. Make the program exit when pressing Q. What did I change?</h3>
<p>
I added one more key check in the event loop, so when the program sees the Q key,
it sets the quit flag to true. Pressing ESC or Q now closes the window.
</p>

<h3>Q3. Make the light come from below in CubeLit.</h3>
<p>
I changed the light direction so the Y value became negative instead of positive.
This makes the light shine upward instead of downward.
</p>

<h3>Q4. Create a triangle model and load it.</h3>
<p>
I made a new file called <b>triangle.txt</b>.  
It has one big triangle. The format matches the cube model:  
8 floats per vertex (position, UV, normal).
</p>

<p>Contents of triangle.txt:</p>

<pre>
24
0.0  1.0  0.0   0.0 1.0   1.0 0.0 0.0
0.0 -1.0 -1.0   0.0 0.0   1.0 0.0 0.0
0.0 -1.0  1.0   1.0 0.0   1.0 0.0 0.0
</pre>

<p>
Then I changed the file name in ModelLoad.cpp from <i>cube.txt</i> to <i>triangle.txt</i>.
After rebuilding, the program shows the large triangle.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
In this homework I practiced running basic OpenGL demos using SDL3.
I tried several small programs, changed a few things like the light direction
and the key inputs, and also loaded my own model.  
Overall, this assignment helped me get more comfortable with how the OpenGL pipeline works.
